# the Custom Character Example Ported from Alyx


just a reminder that this tutorial i ported won't be the most optimal way to set things up at all.
this was done specifically for Alyx. you can do a lot more fun things in S&box than you could in Alyx therefore the example is limited to the capabilities of the Alyx Entities (which might not translate 100% to S&box anyway)

this is suppose to be an overview of a "simple" animgraph compared to the citizen graph. tho the citizen graph does showcase some of the cooler stuff you can do and is the "optimal" way to make an animgraph.
